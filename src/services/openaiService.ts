      "When discussing Ozempic with healthcare providers, emphasize that it's shown to reduce A1C by up to 1.8% in clinical trials and has demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.",
      "The most common side effects of Ozempic include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. These typically decrease over time. It's important to mention that there's a boxed warning about thyroid C-cell tumors, though this has only been observed in animal studies.",
      "Recent clinical data from the STEP program shows that patients using Ozempic achieved significant weight loss compared to placebo, which can be an important talking point when discussing the medication's benefits."
